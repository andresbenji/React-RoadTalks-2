      <p>In the diagram that was given to us we have a component whose initial value is set to 0. When the buttons are clicked their state gets updated and so does the state of the parent component. </p>
      <h2>Why are hooks beneficial?</h2>
      <p>Hooks in React provide several benefits, including improved code organization, reusability of logic through custom hooks, simplified state management within functional components, better performance optimizations through control of side effects and memoization, and an easy-to-learn and widely adopted API. By using hooks, developers can create more modular, readable, and performant code.</p>
